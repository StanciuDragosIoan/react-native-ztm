// original way of developing mobile apps

Apple used Objective-C for their mobile app (appstore)

Swift (Apple added it for easier development)


Google used Java for google playstore

(google added Kotlin later on for better development)


// new ways

Web apps can be used for mobile (cordova/ionic use webview - mobile browser)

Native-like tools (xamarin is the ancestor of that -> compiles c# to native code)

React Native (app runs natively by using native android/ios views)
